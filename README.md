Crypto Piggy is an open source crypto portfolio extension that allows users to track the performance of their Ethereum addresses.

Having to hop around to different portfolio tracking sites and keep a running list of all of your public addresses is a hassle. With Crypto Piggy, all of your information is in one place. After a user registers and inputs their Ethereum public addresses they simply have to click open the chrome extension and all of their portfolio performance information is in one place.

Our dashboard tracks the following views of your portfolio:
 - Last 24 hours
 - Last week
 - Last month
 - Last year
 - Since account creation

We plan on adding additional cryptocurrencies and ERC20 tokens in the coming months.
